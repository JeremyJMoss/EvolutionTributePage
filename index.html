            The Mitsubishi Evolution I was the first generation lancer to be
            produced with the evolution naming. It was a phenomenal car sporting
            the famous 4g63 engine. And an outstanding AWD system.

            The new and improved Mitsubishi Evolution II was released it had
            handling improvements over its younger sibling and increased power
            output. It also had a larger rear spoiler for that extra downforce
            at higher speeds.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution III was released with slight tweaks to the
            already powerful Evo II. including better cooling for the radiator,
            intercooler and brakes based on new nose moulding to allow more air
            flow. with a new compressor housing size and compression ratio for
            the 4G63 which continued to improve on peak power performance.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution IV was born and with it a completely new
            platform. the engine was flipped 180 degrees to reduce torque steer
            and the whole shape and look of the Evo changed.The Evo was also
            heavier than its earlier models but this was countered by adding a
            twinscroll turbocharger to improve response and increase power yet
            again.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution V had not much difference to the Evolution
            IV. There were improvements to the Recaro seats and a slight
            increase in torque. the engine was also strengthened in a few places
            to increase reliability. The body kit was upgraded to add flared
            guards at the rear and some slight beautifying.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution VI had upgraded cooling and engine
            durability with a larger intercooler, larger oil cooler and new
            pistons. But the most exciting thing of all was in December of 1999.
            they released the Tommi-Makinen edition Evo. Named after the famous
            rally driver who had led the Evo to greatness in the rally scene.

            Mitsubishi's next shake up to the Evolution platform was the
            Mitsubishi Evolution VII. This was a much heavier version of the
            wonderful Evo VI but came with multiple chassis tweaks to improve
            grip and handling. the biggest change to this model was the adding
            of AYC (active centre differential) and a more effective limited
            slip differential. Torque and power output were also increased. this
            model also added the auto drivetrain model to the mix.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution VIII had small improvements over the evo 7
            including Brembo brakes and Bilstein shocks to help with the
            increased strain of the rally scene. This model also came out with
            the MR edition which had light-weight aluminium panels to reduce
            weight and increased power to weight ratio. Improvements were also
            made to Mitsubishi's AWD system. the Mr edition was fitted with a 6
            speed transmission unlike the rest of the models in this line up
            that sported the 5 speed.

            The engine in the Mitsubishi Evolution IX got a nice overhaul with
            MIVEC(Mitsubishi Intake Valve Electronic Control) which allowed
            control by the ECU for the intake camshaft allowing more duration of
            intake valve opening at higher RPM. This and a revised turbocharger
            would cause the Evolution IX to achieve the highest ;power levels
            seen in a production 4G63 engine. The Evo IX also sported a less
            "nosey" front bar. which was appreciated by alot of car enthusiasts
            that also liked the look and shape of the Evo VIII.

            The Mitsubishi Evolution X was the final edition in the Evolutions
            life. This vehicle was the only in the evo's histroy to not include
            the famous 4G63 engine. Instead this model was fitted with the 4B11
            which did not have a cast-iron block like the 4G63 but instead has
            an alloy block. this made the engine weaker than the 4g63 and
            couldn't stand up to higher boost levels that the tuning scene
            required. The final edition Evo was also a lot heavier than the
            previous generations. This caused this vehicle to "not hit the mark"
            as alot of car enthusiast would say. Also this vehicle did not come
            out in manual but sported a 6 speed SST gearbox which was a great
            edition and allowed for faster shift times but alot of car
            enthusiasts prefered a manual transmission like most of the models
            before.

      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <p>
        In the end the Mitsubishi Evolution was a legacy of the Mitsubishi rally
        team and thrust them forward into the performance car scene. Sadly after
        the Mitsubishi Evo X the demand for suv's and non performance cars won
        out for mitsubishi and the Evo became one for the history books. The
        Evolution will always remain in the hearts of the Car lover community as
        one of Mitsubishi's engineering marvels and ahead of it's time in
        regards to performance and reliability.
